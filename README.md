# [MIA] My IDE Actions
Since release 2502, there have been IDE Actions in the ABAP Environment. This makes it possible to write your own actions in the ABAP Development Tools. In this repository you will find a collection of different actions.

## Installation

Currently, IDE Actions cannot be saved in Git, so the IDE Actions must first be created after installation. Here you will find all steps to create them.

### Create new class

## Features

Currently the following actions and features are included.

### Create class

Creates a class and optionally the interface, factory and injector. Activate the action on a focused package, the information of the package name and prefix are generated. If the package is assigned to a transport, this transport is also proposed.

![Create class Input](./img/image-01.png)

Interface , Factory and Injector are not mandatory, if you delete the string, the objects and dependencies are not created.


### SELECT Converter

Converts a SELECT statement from classic Open SQL to ABAP SQL and exchanges the table access and fields through Core Data Services if they are released for ABAP Cloud. The basis is the SwH tool "[ABAP Select Converter](https://software-heroes.com/en/abap-select-converter)".

![Convert statement](./img/image-03.png)

The SELECT must be marked, then the statement can be replaced.

### Code Snippets

It takes various code snippets from the [GitHub](https://github.com/Xexer/abap-code-snippets) repository and allows you to parameterize and insert them into the source code. Currently, various objects are supported.

![Code snippets](./img/image-06.png)

### Scope Launchpad

Scope the Launchpad Content as Spaces and Pages that have been created with the ABAP Development Tools. More informations about scoping in this [article](https://software-heroes.com/en/blog/btp-pages-and-spaces-adt).

### Consumption Model fields

It takes a consumption model class that inherits from the superclass /IWBEP/CL_V4_ABS_PM_MODEL_PROV and provides the option to select the appropriate structure from the class. 

![Code snippets](./img/image-08.png)

So the type definition in the class is converted.

```ABAP
TYPES:
  "! <p class="shorttext synchronized" lang="en">CompanyNamesType</p>
  BEGIN OF tys_company_names_type,
    "! <em>Key property</em> CompanyName
    company_name        TYPE c LENGTH 60,
    "! Branch
    branch              TYPE c LENGTH 50,
    "! CompanyDescription
    company_description TYPE c LENGTH 255,
  END OF tys_company_names_type.
```

Finally, the complete field mapping is written to the custom entity to establish integration.

```ABAP 
company_name : abap.char(60);
branch : abap.char(50);
company_description : abap.char(255);
```

## Influence on System

### Security

Here you will find a list of the IDE actions that contact services outside the system when used and in detail which data is transferred.

| IDE Actions      | Endpoint            | Data                     |
|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| SELECT Converter | Software-Heroes API | -> Full SELECT Statement |
| Code Snippets    | GitHub Repository   | <- Code Templates        |

### Changeability

Here you can find information about whether IDE Actions make changes to the system and what is changed.

| IDE Actions              | Change                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Create new class         | Creates new objects    |
| SELECT Converter         | Change code            |
| Code Snippets            | Insert new code        |
| Scope Launchpad          | Change status of items |
| Consumption Model fields | Insert new code        |
